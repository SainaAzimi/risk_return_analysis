# **Portfolio Risk and Return Analysis**
In this Challenge, you'll assume the role of a quantitative analyst for an investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality.
The algorithms choose from various investment styles and options for each client's portfolio to keep the costs low.

In this program we use Pandas to develop a *Python* application that will evaluate four new investment options to be considered in the client portfolios. As a result of this program you can determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.

## Technologies
This application is developed on the *Python 3.7.11 version* 
Jupyter Lab Notebook that is an open sourced, web based user interface for software design, coding, visualization and documentationis is used for running the program that incorporates the following required dependencies:

**Pandas**: To import functions needed to program appliation for financial analysis

**Pathlib**: To load and save files from and to paths

**%matplotlib**: To perform analyticals calculations

**NumPy**: To perform risk calculations

## Installation Guide
The following installation must be performed before running the program:

*Install pathlib*

*Install Jupyter Lab*

*Install Pandas*

## Usage
This section is an explanation of how to use this program: 

We start this application by importing all the necessary libraries, dependencies and data. We analyze the data that was imported to determine if any of the portfolios outperform the broader stock market, which the S&P 500 represents. Using box plots to analyze the volatility of each of the four fund portfolios and of the S&P 500 Index. Volatility analysis helped with determining which of the four fund portfolios is the most volatile. Next, evaluate the risk profile of each portfolio by using the standard deviation and the beta to determine the risk of each portfolio relative to S&P 500. It is necessary to not only consider the risk metrics but also the risk_return profile of the portfolio. Finally, it is required to evaluate how the portfolios react relative to the broader market to determine the recommended portfolio.
